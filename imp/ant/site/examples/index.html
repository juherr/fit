This is the first account, the first narrative. There was neither man,
nor animal, birds, fishes, crabs, trees, stones, caves, ravines, grasses,
nor forests; there was only the sky.<p>--The Popol Vuh, sacred book of
the Quiche Maya.

<p>In learning a new programming language, toolkit, or library, some
people write "Hello, World".  One I knew would write a hex dump utility.
I calculate Mayan dates. Probably my very first real programming effort
involved taking a Mayan date calculator written in FORTRAN and re-creating
it in C. Since then I've rewritten it many times, and used the basic code
as the core for implementing a prototype to learn new things, including
web CGIs, servlets, Mozilla XPCOM, Web Services, and more. It was 
the natural choice for my foray into FIT.</p>

The Mayans knew about 0 and counted in base 20.  This page really can't do
justice to the Mayan date system.  Read 
<a href="http://webexhibits.org/calendars/calendar-mayan.html
">more about Mayan calendar systems</a>.

<p>Unless otherwise noted, expected values are those generated with the
<a href="http://www.mayabelize.ca/maya/longcountgenerator.shtml">Maya Long
Count Date Generator</a></p>

If you are interested in duplicating these results in your own code, you'll
want to get a good reference on basic date conversions.  Start by generating
Julian day from a Gregorian calendar date.  Use the Julian day to generate
the Mayan dates.  Probably the best technical reference on the web is at
<a href="http://www.mayacalendar.com/mayacalendar/menu.html">Maya World Studies Center<a/>.
