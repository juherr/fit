<h1>AntFit</h1>
<div id="main">
<hr>
Fit task for Ant.  Requested on the FIT wiki <a href="http://fit.c2.com/wiki.cgi?MakingRunners">MakingRunners</a> page.

<h2>Overview</h2>


This is an external task for Ant that will invoke the FIT engine on the
test input file.

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

<h3>Context</h3>
In a development effort consisting largely of Java where the chosen tool for
the project's build is Apache Ant.

<h3>Intent</h3>
The integration with Ant allows the acceptance tests to be run as part of the
overall build.  In projects where a build and deploy is complex and requires
integration with application servers or other complexities, having the power
of Ant to handle the steps and run the tests together is an important
benefit.

<h3>Description</h3>
The basic runner iterates over a FileSet of test documents in the specified
input directory, and leaves the results in an output directory.

<h2>Tests</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The task loads the fixture html documents from a specified location.</li>
  <li>The runner executes each fixture.</li>
  <li>The result html files are written to the specified output directory.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Not Gonna Do It</h2>

Things this tools will not address. TBD.

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<h2>The Nitty-Gritty</h2>

For now, see <a href="quickstart.html">the quickstart.</a>

<h2>Open Issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We might be inclined to offer an option to only run those tests
  where the input is newer than the corresponding output.</li>

  <li>There are ways to set up the ant dependencies to only run the
  tests if there has been a change that required any recompilation.
  The examples page will eventually cover that.</li>

  <li>Perhaps Ant could build an index.html page linking to all the
  sub-documents and write that into the output directory?  Have to watch
  for name collisions if index.html is already one of the names.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes To Specific Audiences</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Technical Notes</h3>
        The choice to subclass WikiRunner rather than the basic FileRunner was
	deliberate.  In playing with various documents it became clear that
        having the ability to segregate fixture content from non-fixture
	content was a desirable feature.  If anyone has a different story,
        this choice could be made configurable.
