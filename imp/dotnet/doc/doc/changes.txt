Differences from the Java version of FIT:

* Type parsing is done automatically.  There's no need to
create a "parse" method in your fixture.  In fact, that's not
supported.  If a type is mentioned in your fixture, make sure
it implements these three methods:
  - string ToString()
  - void Parse(string)
  - bool Equals(object)
All of the basic C# types implement those methods.  The
ScientificDouble class that comes with FIT has been augmented
to implement those methods.

* In order to load fixtures, C# has to know the location of
the fixture assembly.  The test runners have an extra
"fixture path" parameter that you can use to specify which
directory your fixture assembly is in.  This path is configured
to support common C# assembly paths by default.  See the
command-line help for more information.
