    - Copy results to clipboard - the contents of the view is copied
      to the clipboard. The format is suitable for pasting into

      This may be specified either as absolute path, or relative path
      (relative to the configurtion file) or a variable reference,
      e.g. ${infiledir} - directory of the input file.
      Supported variables are: indir, outdir, infiledir, outfiledir

    - if sorting is on, vies does not resort on every single
      change, but the user has to press the "re-sort" button.
      This seems to be better, than the immediate resort of
      the 008 build, as selected entries cannot disappear of the 
      visible part of the entries in view.
    - new column "timestamp of last run"
    - cell padding in the view
    - column titles are localisable, currently localised for
      german
