libunicode is a library for manipulating Unicode characters and
strings.  It understands both the UTF-8 and UCS-2 encodings, and has a
framework for adding support for new encodings.

================================================================

Some design notes:

You might wonder why we always advertise unicode_iconv* instead of
just using the native ones when available.  The reason is that some
programs, like Guile, want to be able to advertise a way to plug in
converters.  We provide that by using the native iconv() as a first
attempt and then falling back to our converters.
