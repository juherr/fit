          <h1>Overview</h1>

          <p>Fit is a tool for enhancing collaboration between members of a software product.  It's a way for customers, testers, and developers to communicate precisely using familiar tools.</p>

          <p>Fit tests are created by customers with the assistance of testers.  It's best when used for complicated customer scenarios, such as difficult business rules.  It's not a general-purpose system testing tool nor is it meant to replace your existing black-box testing techniques.  (Although you may find that you can reduce the amount of black-box testing once Fit is well established.)  Instead, Fit is an invaluable way to collaborate on complicated problems&mdash;and get them right&mdash;early in development.</p>

          <p>Fit is freely available under the GNU General Public License.</p>


          <h2>How It Works</h2>

          <p>Fit takes examples written by a customer, checks them against your software, and colors each example red or green depending on whether the software works the way the example says it should.</p>

          <p>The process starts with a customer creating examples of important scenarios their software must handle.</p>

          <p>EXAMPLE (sketch)</p>

          <p>The customer, working with testers and developers, refines these examples using business-friendly tools such as Microsoft Excel and Word and eventually incorporates them into a document.  Testers suggest additional areas to cover and developers make sure the tables are written in a way that works with Fit.</p>

          <p>EXAMPLE (table)</p>

          <p>The document is saved as HTML and developers create "fixtures:" small bits of program code that can understand the examples and try them out on the software being developed.  The Fit framework provides infrastructure to make this easy.</p>

          <p>EXAMPLE (fixture)</p>

          <p>As the fixtures are completed, Fit is run on the document and the results are reported to the whole team.  At first, some examples fail and are colored red.  As the software nears completion, more examples are colored green, showing that the software works the way the examples say it should.</p>

          <p>EXAMPLE (Fit output)</p>

          <p>Once the software is done, the document is kept for future reference and included in developers' automatic build tools to make sure nothing stops working.</p>

          <p>EXAMPLE (Fit command-line)</p>
